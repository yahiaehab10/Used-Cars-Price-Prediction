## Data Preparation

In this section, we load and prepare the training and testing datasets for the regression analysis.

## Data Exploration

We explore the datasets to understand their structure, check for missing values, and gain insights into the data.

## Linear Regression

### Model Setup

We implement a Linear Regression model for predicting car selling prices based on the year and kilometers driven.

### Data Split

We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### Multi-Feature Equation

#### Train

We train the Linear Regression model using the training data.

#### Test

We test the model and make predictions for car selling prices using the test data.

#### Accuracy Comparison

We compare the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Gradient Descent

We also experiment with a Gradient Descent-based Linear Regression model and evaluate its accuracy.

## Polynomial Regression

We perform Polynomial Regression analysis to determine the best degree for the polynomial and assess its RMSE.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, bokeh).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform Linear and Polynomial Regression on the provided dataset.
